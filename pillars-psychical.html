            <li class="pillars__li">If you are addicted to something (alcohol, cigarettes, unhealthy food, work, games, etc.) – go to the clinic as soon as possible or try to get out of it yourself. If there is something else besides you that governs your life – there
              is no
              harmony. Addictions additionally exclude the possibility of healthy life. If you think “you can end this at any moment” then start now, in this moment when you’re reading this. If that fails – look for help. Do not use any excuses that
              “everything is for the people” because it is simply not true.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Every day find time just for yourself and dare to be with yourself. Think and talk to yourself.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Think about the proportions of different activities in your everyday life. If, for example, childcare takes so much time that it overwhelms you – try to find a way out. Different division of responsibilities between adults, sometimes
              ask
              someone from outside to help, so that you can rest.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Consider whether the work does not take too much of your time. Maybe it is worth to reorganize, maybe it is possible to work for example shorter, but more effective, and spent time with family or sport. A lot of people lose a lot of
              time
              working on unproductive seating, mindless internet games, etc. This leads to apathy.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Make sure you sleep well and at the right time and with the right length. It is during sleep that the body regenerates and rebuilds the tissues. If you will not provide it – it will be like a neglected building.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Take care of proper nutrition. It significantly affects the mood and the desire to live. For example, many people claim that white bread and pastry causes them apathy and feeling sleepy during the day.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Do not get angry at small things, it’s not worth it.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">If there is something you can not change – accept it.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Develop your passions.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li">Be happy – it’s in you, open up to happiness.</li>
