          <p>So today im going to keep it short and sweet and give you a few simple (but effective) facts for building that Greek God bod!
            By following this approach you’ll not only sky rocket your metabolism but you'll also increase your resting heart rate and burn twice as many calories in a day,
            leading to that perfect beach bod!

    <div class="paragraph clearfix">
      <h4 class="paragraph__title">First and Foremost:</h4>
      <img src="images/weights.jpg" alt="weights" class="paragraph__img paragraph__img--right">
      <div class="paragraph__text paragraph__text--left">
        <strong>Increase your lifting weight!</strong> You should strive to add more weight to the bar/machine/dumbells, etc.. each week.
        I can't stress the importance of this! Even if it’s the smallest of increases, you’re still adding on more weight which will lead to progressive overload.
        Generally, I would recommend trying to increase by 1.25-2.5kg each week on all movements that you feel comfortable to do so!

    <div class="paragraph clearfix">
      <h4 class="paragraph__title">Secondly..</h4>
      <img src="images/increase_reps.jpg" alt="Increasing Reps" class="paragraph__img paragraph__img--left">
      <div class="paragraph__text paragraph__text--right">
        <strong>Increase your reps!</strong> You’ll be happy to hear this.. you don’t always <strong>need</strong> to increase weight! Another great way you can progress is by
        increasing the number of reps per set. So say for example if you’ve been going 3 sets of 10 for a while now, increase it to 3 sets of 12, and BAM!
        You’ve applied progressive overload! Let the gains begin! The when those 3 sets of 12 get easy, that means an increase in weight needs to be made.

    <div class="paragraph clearfix">
      <h4 class="paragraph__title">Thirdly..</h4>
      <img src="images/technique.jpg" alt="improving technique" class="paragraph__img paragraph__img--right">
      <div class="paragraph__text paragraph__text--left">
        <strong>Improve technique!</strong>This is another really good form of progressive overload, especially if you want to make sure you continue using the right
        muscle groups and prevent injury! Your form needs to be picture perfect before you can increase weight on all movements. A good que I like to use is the last rep of
        a set should look exactly like the first! If that’s not the case for you then you may be going a little too heavy and there may be some ego-lifting going on! Drop the weight friend,
        no one is judging you! It will always be a bigger pay off to have your form correct, than to be lifting heavier weights incorrectly.

    <div class="textBox">
      <h4 class="textBox__title">Finally for today..</h4>
      <p><strong>Decreased RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion).</strong>This is a term commonly used in powerlifting. To simplify it for you it is a scale that you go by to measure
        how difficult a given set was. So for example, if the final rep at the end of a given set was extremely difficult, then that would be ranked 8 or 9 on the RPE scale.
        Likewise, if it was easy it would be ranked a 5 or 6 on the RPE scale. So if the number on the RPE scale lowers that means you’re getting stronger, which means progressive
        overload is being applied! WOO!
