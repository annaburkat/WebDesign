            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--green">Workouts – minimum 3 times a week. Write it permanently in your weekly schedule.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">Choose different forms of physical activity. The easiest way to do this is in a fitness club offering different types of workouts, but exercising at home or outdoors can also provide you with variety. It is important to move and develop all muscle groups.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">Take care of your spine. At least during one workout a week you should practice yoga, pilates, swimming or other forms of exercise that emphasize spine gymnastics and care for the muscles that hold it. Many illnesses and sufferings in the middle age are caused by neglect of the spine. It is not only the main element of our skeleton, but also a vital part of the nervous and energetic systems.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">Choose the kinds of activities that give you joy. There is a choice!</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">Do not be afraid of pain. The slight muscle pain you are trying to exert will sometimes appear, but if you take care of stretching – you will eliminate it. If during training it is very painful – stop practicing.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">Remember about stretching the whole body before EVERY workout. It will prepare the muscles for effort and you will avoid pain. It will also improve the flexibility of the body and its elasticity.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">Do general warm-up before each workout.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">After one type of training like running or cycling, also stretch your muscles.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">If you are practicing in the morning before going to work or school – you can train on an empty stomach only after drinking a glass of warm water or a flaxseed brew. Breakfast (carbohydrate) eat after taking a shower.</li>
            <li class="pillars__li pillars__li--gray">Hydrate your body during and after your workout.</li>
