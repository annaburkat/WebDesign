            <p> <strong>Hello there!</strong> I suppose you're on this page to find out how we got started and why we do what we do? Well it's quite simple really,
              we are a bunch of four like minded friends who have experiences with varying diets and lifestyles which we are pasionate about and
              would like to pass on these experiences to others who may not know where to begin. There are many different diet types with a great number of people
              who swear by each of them for different reasons, so we thought we would compile our thoughts and opinions on each one listed for anyone and everyone to
              digest.
              <p>
                <p>
                  As we were listing out thoughts and experiences on these varying diets we got the idea to also list a bunch of recipes that we have enjoyed over the years
                  that are not too difficult to make! After all it's no fun to have to eat the same exact meals everyday, as even if they are
                  just as good for you no matter how many times you eat them, it can get very boring eating avacado with every meal (even though we love avacado!)
                </p>
                <p>
                  We sincerly hope you enjoyed browsing our website and have learned something new towars living a healthier and happier life!
                  And if you would like to contact us about anything, please visit our <a href="contact.html"> contact page</a>. <em>Happy eating!</em>
                </p>
